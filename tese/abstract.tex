This project's scope is to design and implement a recommender system computational library for e-commerce, with the goal to make the implementation of a generic recommender system simple and easy so it can be used in the email marketing generation process. A thorough study of the main recommendation calculation methods was needed to reach our objectives, covering from user-item relationship definition to item comparison and it's diverse a attributes.

The library was developed using three different recommendation algorithms. The feature weighted is a hybrid method, getting it's base from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, in which a linear regression is calculated from a social-network database, extracting the weights that determine each attribute importance. The second method, based in user profiles, considers the users' interests in specific features, indirectly calculated through the users' interest in different items. The third method, based in the user-item correlation, is derived from the method based in users' profiles. This method searches for them items with the features that are more similar to the attributes that the user has shown interest for.
